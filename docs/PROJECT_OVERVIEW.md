## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Overview

### Core Features
- **User Management**: Separate customer and worker accounts with role-based access
- **Job Management**: CRUD operations for job postings with status tracking
- **Bidding System**: Workers can bid on jobs, customers can select winners
- **Payment Processing**: Secure payment handling with multiple methods
- **Review System**: Bidirectional reviews between customers and workers
- **Wallet System**: Worker payment management
- **Email Notifications**: Automated notifications for key events

### Technology Stack
- **Framework**: Django 5.2.2 with Django REST Framework
- **Authentication**: JWT tokens with SimpleJWT
- **Database**: SQLite (dev) / PostgreSQL (prod)
- **File Storage**: Local files (dev) / AWS S3 (prod)
- **Email**: SMTP with configurable backends

## üì± API Endpoints

### Authentication
```
POST /api/register/     - User registration
POST /api/login/        - User login
POST /api/token/        - Obtain JWT token
POST /api/token/refresh/ - Refresh JWT token
```

### Jobs
```
GET    /api/jobs/              - List all jobs
POST   /api/jobs/create/       - Create new job
PUT    /api/jobs/<id>/update/  - Update job
DELETE /api/jobs/<id>/delete/  - Delete job
```

### Bidding & Assignment
```
POST /api/worker/bid/           - Submit bid
POST /api/jobs/assign_bid/      - Assign worker to job
GET  /api/customer/jobs/bids/   - View job bids
```

### Payments & Reviews
```
POST /api/payments/                        - Create payment
POST /api/jobs/<id>/review_worker/         - Review worker
POST /api/jobs/<id>/review_customer/       - Review customer
```

## üóÑÔ∏è Database Schema

### Core Models
- **User**: Extended Django user with customer/worker roles
- **Worker**: Extended worker profile with skills and verification
- **Job**: Job postings with budget, location, and status
- **Bid**: Worker bids on jobs with amounts and status
- **Payment**: Payment processing with multiple methods
- **Review**: Bidirectional review system
- **WorkerWallet**: Payment management for workers

### Key Relationships
- Users can be customers, workers, or both
- Jobs belong to customers and can be assigned to workers
- Bids connect workers to jobs with proposed amounts
- Payments are tied to completed jobs
- Reviews are bidirectional between job participants
